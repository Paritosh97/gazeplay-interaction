# Interaction methods for eye tracking in games for cognitive disabled people

## About Me

My name is Paritosh and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Informatics at Université Grenoble Alpes - ENSIMAG. My major field of interest is Graphics, Vision and Robotics.

## About the Project

The project aims at adding a new eye interaction method for [GazePlay](https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/). The goals are,

 - Modify existing GazePlay Kernel to support a different technique for interaction.
 - Port previous games and add new games to test the the new technique.
 - Compare the new means of interaction with the previous one.
